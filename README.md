# Shuyu's personal project
**Jan 30, 2024**

## Application purpose:
This application will enable users to craft a message that is concealed within a 
virtual world. One must navigate and explore this world to uncover each character, 
ultimately revealing the full message.

*How it works:*
- The 'creator' creates a new world and types in a message
- Each character in the message is coded as an 'X' object
- The 'user' then wanders around and collects the objects one after the other
- They can save at any time and come back later
- Once they have collected every character in the phrase the message is revealed

## Who will use it?
- Couples!
- Anyone trying to send someone else a cute message in an encoded way

## Why is this project of interest to you?
- I think it will challenge my coding abilities to create both the user interface and the backend system
- I want to make messages for my friends!

## User stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to add a found character to my list of characters I've uncovered so far
2. As a user, I want to be able to view all the characters I have found so far
3. As a user, I want to be able to create new 'worlds' for someone to play with an arbitrary length message
4. As a user, I want to be able to collect characters by running into them in the game
